This test shows that PyADOLC usually creates different tapes than ADOLC.
The reason for that is due to Python's garbage collector that is only called once in a while.
Only then the destructors of temporary variables are called and ADOLC (potentially) reuses free locints.

Python allows to call the garbage collector manually with the function del().
In pyadolc.py two tapings are performed: one without calling the garbage collector (tape_9.tex) and one with manual garbage collecting (tape_10.tex).

Step by Step:
1) compile adolc.exe with scons
2) run ./adolc.exe ---> output tape_11.tex
3) run python pyadolc.py ---> ouput tape_9.tex and tape_10.tex
4) compare tape_9.tex resp. tape_10.tex with tape_11.tex, e.g. with kompare or diff
